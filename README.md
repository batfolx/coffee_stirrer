# coffee_stirrer

<div>
  <p>
    I simply got tired of stirring my own coffee in the morning.

    So I made my own coffee stirrer. I basically 3D printed a small stand and flipped a simple
    DC motor upside down. The way you turn it on is you push a button that is connected to the Arduino Nano
    and it tells the motor controller to turn the DC motor.
